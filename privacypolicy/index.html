		<h1>Dot Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Dot doesn't store any data. There is no code inside it to allow that. Your music stays with you.</p>
		<p>Dot doesn't make any HTTP or HTTPS calls. This means that the app physically doesn't communicate with any remote servers.</p>
		<p>All the data that Dot uses is stored on-device using the system music library.</p>
